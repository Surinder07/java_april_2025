## Recap 

Generics 
Immutable class 
List - ArrayList and LinkedList 
packages 
Inner classes - Annoymous Inner class 

ArrayList ?

Dynamic collection - resize possible
elements are stored order of insertion
duplicates are allowed 
inherits from List interface 
search operations are faster in arraylist 
indexes help us to search faster 


LinkedList 
Node, HEad and tail, 
address of the previous and next node 
manipulation is faster

ArrayList           LinkedList




## Set

Stores unique elements, duplicates are not allowed 

                    Set 
        |           |           |
    HashSet      TreeSet    LinkedHashSet


## HashSet
1. Duplicates are not allowed 
2. only 1 null element is allowed
3. [Stored in random order] 
4. Internally , HashSet uses HashMap 

## TreeSet 
no duplicates 
null is not allowed 
[elements are stored in the natural sorting order]


## LinkedHashSet

duplicates not allowed 
order of insertion is maintained
null is also allowed 


## iterator 

for, foreach loop 


Iterator 












# Stack , Queue, 









## Map
