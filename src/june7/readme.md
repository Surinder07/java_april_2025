## Recap 

1. Polymorphism
2. inheritance 

single , multi level

1. compile time 
2. runtime 


method overloading vs method overriding 


## Encapsulation 


create Team with fields
1. String playerUserName 
2. String playerEmail
3. String playerPassword 
4. double salary

login to the app 

1. they should be able to update the password, but can not get previous password 
2. fetch the userName but can not update it  
3. fetch email also  but can not update email.
4. no one should be able to see the salary and update as well

# Abstraction 

1. using abstract class  [0-100 %]
2. Using interfaces  [100 % ]



create abstract 
1. use abstract keyword for the class 
2. abstract classes can not be instantiated 
[You cannot create object of abstract class ]
3.  if a class is abstract it may or may not have abstract methods 
4. if a class have abstract method, class must be abstract 
5. abstract methods does not have body
