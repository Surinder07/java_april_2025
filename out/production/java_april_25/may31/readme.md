## Recap 

Strings 
StringBuilder 
StringBuffer

String constant pool 



String s1 = "Pragra";
String s2 = "Pragra";
String s3 = new String("Pragra");

s1 == s3 ,   true 
s1.equals s2 = true 


== and    - reference   
.equals   - content 



## 
Class - blueprint of object 
user defined data type 
logical entity 


Objects 
instance of class 


class 
1. constructors  - default and param
2. methods 
3. variables - instance variables  
4. local variables - 
5. static variables


## OOP
4 pilars 
1. Inheritance 

  class  Iphone 10 [Gen 10 ], camera, face id, calling, UI, screen , Alarm
     |
  class  Iphone 16 [Gen 16], Alarm {}


code resuability 

2. Polymorphism
more than one form 
method overloading 

compile time polymorphism   --- method overloading  
runtime    - method overriding 


Data hiding 
3. Encapsulation
combining the data into single unit.
we control what data should be avaialble to others 

4. Abstraction 
Hiding the complexity 

abstract 



C++
C# 
python 
swift 
javascript 
Objective C 




## Inheritance 


1. Single

Class A [Parent class , Base class, Super class ]
   \
Class B  [Child class, Sub class, derived class ]


class 






2.multi level 




2. multiple inheritance , through classes , interfaces 






## IS - A relationship
## Has - A relationship 


Laptop is a Computer 
Dog is an Animal 

Car is a Vehicle 

Laptop is a keyboard

Laptop has a keyboard 

Car is a seat 
Car has a seat
