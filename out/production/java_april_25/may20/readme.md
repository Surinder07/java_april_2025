## Recap 
1. Constructor - default and param
2. constructor chaining 
3. variables - local, instance
4. Method overloading 
5. Objects
6. this ?

## variables 
1. local variables - which has scope within methods
2. instance - within the class
3. static variable


## static variable 

shareable property of a class 
loaded into memory when the class loaded 


// Bottle of water  - 5 people 

variable 
method 
class 
static block 

## main 

      //   Demo demo = new Demo(); object is not required to call a static method.

        Demo.show();
 


        // Object Oriented 
        // JVM - java virtual machine 
        

## Library Management 
class LibraryManagement 
studentName, 
bookTitle, 
author,
static totalBooksIssued

# Constructor 
1. studentName, bookTitle
increment the totalBooks Issued

# methods
printInfo()
should print bookName, studentName

static showTotalIssued()

# Objects
create 3 books issued. 



## we can not delete the object from the method

Student s = new Student();
s = null;


new Student(); // object will stay in the memory
